We have the same publishing spirit as many other japanese doujin circles, but our ambitions are not focused on a specific series or style of music. Whether they’re for original work or arrangement projects, we want to feature as many artists as we can on our albums from new musical adepts to well known veterans. Please check out our list of ongoing projects if you wanna hop in!"

			"description": "KodamaSounds albums are doujin album projects that are constantly growing and ongoing. On this page, you can have direct access to our current album plans and projects, to which you can participate at any time. We follow a schedule that we update regularly, and we generally calibrate deadlines for brand new projects in advance. It is preferred for artists to focus on albums with a release date, but It is still possible for you to contribute to any sequel albums that do not have a set release date yet - just please understand it may take a while, or even one or two years, if not more, for those to release."

No popularity contest, no favoritism: You wanna hop in? You can! And if you’re struggling, we’ll help out."
