  "eclectic-resonance-uprising": {
    "desc": "Sometimes you just need a good burst of dopamine to help through tough times. Sometimes you just need to headbang to some absurd tunes. Absurd drums, absurd sampling… Some might call it music for the deranged, and not for the faint of heart. Maybe they’re right. But we’re into it, and that’s not gonna stop us from making even more. ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING is all about original hardcore electronic music, J-core, and whatever name you wanna give it."

  "eclectic-resonance-detuned-alloy": {
    "desc": "Grab your gear, and get your fingers in shape: Detuned Alloy is an album for all guitar lovers out there. “Detuned Alloy” is the Rock/Hard Rock/Metal variant of our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series, where the featured tracks are focused on all kinds of acoustic/rock music styles. For centuries, guitars and guitar-like instruments have been used for their flexibility and sonic characteristics. More recently, innovations such as the electric guitar have completely transformed and defined the sounds of genres ranging from blues and rock to heavy metal and jazz. Whether clean or distorted, acoustic or electric, the timbre of the guitar has affected or shaped a significant portion of the music that we listen to today, and KodamaSounds is celebrating that legacy with ECLECTIC RESONANCE Detuned Alloy."

  "gensokyo-party-vol4": {
    "desc": "\"DJ Koishi\" is a variant of our \"Gensokyo Party\" series, where the featured tracks are planned to be very rhythmic, juicy, electronic and noisy.  The green haired satori has had enough. She’s bored to death, and manipulating people is just not as fun as it used to be… And thus, she decided to become a DJ! Manipulating people through thick beats is much more fun than using your powers! …Wait, seriously?"

  "eclectic-resonance-hollow-horizons": {

    "desc": "Legends once foretold of a magical music compilation… One with heroic pieces, and warm songs of nostalgia. ECLECTIC RESONANCE Legendaria is a tale not to be forgotten… Warning: This album may contain tunes only fit for slaying demon lords, wandering through neverending mossy forests, drinking at the tavern, and more. “Legendaria” is the Fantasy variant of our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series, where the featured tracks are inspired by JRPGs, Anime soundtracks, classical and celtic music. Classical instruments evocating fantasy sceneries are recommended. Feel free to inspire yourself with the style of your favorite RPG songs and composers for this album!"

Inspired by long pieces and intoxicating trance/progressive house, we hope that you can close your eyes while listening to this album, and feel ready to face the day."

  "gensokyo-party-vol6": {
    "desc": "The barrier that once held Gensokyo together and free of the turmoil of the outside world is no more. The shrine maiden is at a standstill, faced with the ruins of what once was her home - saccaged and ruined by the turmoil of the outside world. Now, Gensokyo is nothing but the shadow of its former self. Fragments and shards of memories scattered around, old friends and enemies alike now fight for their lives. As some try to rebuild what they loved and holds firm, the other ones try to move on and build something anew. “Border in Stasis” is a conceptual Touhou arrange album project, and is probably our most ambitious one to this day. “Gensokyo in Ruins” is the keyword, and advocates the melancholy of Gensokyo, deprived of its former glory. Through emotional pieces, songs of recollection, and tunes of turmoil."

	"lapis-lazuli": {
		"desc": "A deep dive in the ocean that just goes on  as far as the abyss. In there, our thoughts blend as the colors dim. The blue from the sky and the sea become nothing but astral projections of our collective unconsciousness. In this dark world, our imagination breaks free and takes ahold of reality. \"Yume ga ukiyo ka, Ukiyo ga yume ka\" ; is The Dream just a floating world, or is the world just a fleeting dream? So clear your mind, take a deep breath and join us in the heart of the sea, within the Lapis Lazuli."
