This album was even pressed and distributed in Japan! It’s a dream I’ve had for a long time, one I thought was unattainable until now but the stars aligned with the live presentation of the album for M3. One aspect I particularly appreciate about Kodama is the natural kindness of its members, a strong sense of mutual support and community that encourages you to push yourself further. Even though we compose on our own, there are always plenty of members available. Personally, I find this amazing because I love creating alone but surrounding myself with others when it’s needed. A big thank you to Kodama for everything it brings me, both creatively and personally, in my own individual growth!",

And yet, getting invited cheered me up enough to make something incredible, and I think that's the best thing about working with KodamaSounds. They're a group of people who love making music of all kinds. And that love is contagious, it inspires everyone to keep making music. I think that's what matters most.

I also chose to combine new and old, as KodamaSounds does itself in its albums of wide varieties of music, and albums of celebrating modern culture. KodamaSounds was one of the first consistently professional quality music publishing groups I ever contributed to, and I am very grateful for these opportunities to make what I am passionate about alongside other talented musicians.

Having started out in chiptune, I am very pleased to have been featured alongside the other spectacular artists on the \"ECLECTIC RESONANCE Memories\" albums. Having also been featured on the second \"UPRISING\" release, I can't say I feel I'm on the same level as other contributors, though the energy on display makes me want to get better! It's been wonderful to be associated with a circle that resonates such positive energy, and I'm always excited to see each new release. For YGGDRASIL, I tried not to come in with any preconception of what I should make. I did my best to sit down and let something come out. I had recently bought a Korg opsix as a hardware synth and controller, and decided to put it to work here. Almost all elements of the track, save for percussion and effects, were generated and recorded from the opsix. I usually work exclusively with softsynths, so the change of pace was invigorating! I ended up with something pretty airy, floating somewhere between techno and trance. I was expecting to make something harder if I'm honest, but perhaps I'm stuck in the clouds... I am at a point in my life where I am forced to balance my creative spirit with harsh realities and responsibilities. This circle has helped me maintain that balance. It's been a pleasure to contribute what I can, and I hope to do so well into the future. Happy 5th, KodamaSounds!! o(*￣▽￣*)o",

At this time, I had only a few months ago decided I wanted to pursue music composition professionally, and I was looking for communities I could contribute to, so I could build a portfolio. At the tail end of 2023, I made my first KodamaSounds appearance on Katamania!! -a Katamari tribute album-. Since then, I've gotten heavily involved in Kodama's albums. The ECLECTIC RESONANCE series in particular has been an immensely fun and valuable challenge in diversifying my portfolio and skillset, and I've greatly enjoyed maintaining a streak of appearances (up until Memories 2, so sad). Every album theme has given me new inspiration and new avenues of exploring and refining my sound, and I unquestionably would not be the musician I am today without the consistency of Kodama's projects. 2 years after my first Kodama appearance, I'm back once again to deliver a track for this 5th anniversary album. In terms of both my prowess and my career, a lot has changed in that relatively short time. I am the most confident producer I can be right now, and I have notable game composing credits to my name, which seemed a distant impossibility back in 2023. The journey to these achievements was made with KodamaSounds being a constant spotlight on my portfolio.

I see KDMS as a \"hub\" or a \"center station\" of every \"sub-community\" in the DTM space. there's ALWAYS someone I know from other servers or communities I'm in. Here's to more Compilations, more singles, more chuuni, more ARF ARF, more fumos, more missed deadlines because ADHD - and most importantly: MORE FUN DTM THINGS",

I've been contributing to Kodama for the last 4 years or so, and despite my insecurities on my japanese level, I did my best to make the circle just a bit more international. Seeing a lot of new japanese artists working with us made me really happy. Spending all those years studying wasn't for nothing... is what I always think when I listen to all those wonderful songs from the japanese artists we could work with. And now I'm on the path of making my dream come true, and I hope I'll be able to be the face of Kodama in Japan! Let's keep growing and touch many more hearts 🔥",

We might be different as people and often vary in our opinions, but I believe that the albums turned out amazing because we dared to speak out to each other on areas to improve, and make a decision as a team by hook or by crook before moving on.

    "comment": "I'm incredibly grateful to contribute to a doujin circle like KodamaSounds. As someone who has been trying to kickstart their music as a means to be financially sound and collaborative, it was very difficult back in 2018 since I was just in the cusp of starting to get good at writing compositions for general audiences. However, I noticed that the usual methods of advertising yourself and getting gigs was not feasible especially with the advent of COVID lock-downs so I went back to my roots and started participating in music jams for fun. I guess that's where I caught a lot of attention, and figured I would be a good fit for something. Well, that something happened with Memories being worked on and I figured it would be cool to put out a chiptune track done in MML to show that yes there are people in the West that are invested into making music in this fashion that's commonplace in Japan. From there, everything started to fall into place and now I'm part of three music circles and done collaborative efforts for people's albums or even some singles for fun. The ultimate lesson I can give to creatives is to never be afraid of venturing out to creative spaces that are new to you, and also to give respect to creatives of all backgrounds and skill levels because we look up to each other for anything that we might need help with which is key in order to progress the culture we are invested and cultivated in. There's a quote that I have given myself years ago, and it's that I always strive to be \"Unquotable, Unpredicatable, and Unsuitable\". Ironic I know, but it's up to interpretation and it's more fun that way. :D",
