					"• Composer & Arranger: Nuchuu","","• Programmed, Produced, Mixed & Mastered by Nuchuu","• Additional Mastering: ceiling adjust","","• Used Software: Ableton Live 11","","• About this track: This track's inspiration came from representing thinking or contemplating negatively. The slow build of uncertainties, the hit of too much negativity at once, the way it can all suddenly shift, and the potential lack of resolutions. The emotional journey that takes place within, often in solitude, rather than externally. The track is experimental in overall arrangement and some key choices, and it focuses on meaningful expression over conforming to genre standards or prioritizing consistency in feel throughout.","","BPM: 120","Key: G Minor","Genre: Ambient/Experimental Electronic"

Let's hope I can make something more melodic sooner than later...",

This time it's an ambient techno (also trance-ish?) track w/ really big kicks, weird sparkly synths and a lot of reverb. The voice in the song talks about the concept of a \"cybermind\" - a fully capable virtual mind functioning in cyberspace. I hope these elements make the song more exciting and mysterious overall.
