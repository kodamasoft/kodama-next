It subverts the meaning of the phrase \"kys\", and uses the theming of kawaii, like a magical girl transition, to instead tell you to \"become the one you were \"meant to be\", and that you are \"absolutely deserving of love\". The tone of the track resembles mania and conflict, the kind of feelings relevant when needing reassurance and direction to focus back on your values. Every positive upbeat message is paired with harsh bass and drums, conflicting sounds, sudden transitions in tone. Kawaii Yourself (verb) - Become the one you were always meant to be.",

While I don't believe it meets the same standards, I am proud of how it turned out and hope others are too. During production I chose to do it all by ear, I had heard many lapix, Mameyudoufu, PSYQUI, and Srav3R tracks over and over again and used them as inspiration. Towards the end I got inspired to add a little bit of artcore/breaks because I found myself listening to a lot of Mili over the week, too.",

I was looking to submit it to hypertrance, but something stopped me from doing so. Then, earlier this year, I revisited the project for ECLECTIC RESONANCE Escapism, but the song didn't fit into the overall hopeful mood of the album. Finally, as the deadline for ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING 3 drew near, I gave the track one last shot, and third time was the charm. Though the project file itself wasn't the easiest to work with, my ideas from 2 years ago were surprisingly still compelling to me - I think it builds a great spaciousness, and the arps and gated chords sound divine. I'm happy to release this track at last.",

					"PSYQUO: Hi, it's PSYQUO. This time collabing with Volumetrique, we made a Tech DnB track. For the concept I had while making parts of the track - the song reflects the many things we see in the world. This sadness and hopeless is what many of us are feeling right now. I hope these feelings come through the song. As for the collab, I originally approached Volumetrique to make a Schranz track, but after a bit of  back and forth, we decided to do DnB instead. (Schranz collab when) A big thank you to Volumetrique for making the track whole!",
					"Volumetrique: Dan here. I've finally had the opportunity of releasing a track as Volumetrique on KodamaSounds... And it's a Tech DnB banger with feelings™, inspired by the likes of IMANU, The Caracal Project, C&K... With the massive help and gorgeous sound design skills of PSYQUO, we've cooked a snappy, tech-neurofunk-ish track. You won't find any snappier drums anywhere else at M3 ;) ( ok, maybe at Supire's :P ). I've been immensely carried by PSYQUO, who also initiated the collab and I'm deeply thankful for the opportunity, through the highs and the lows. We ended up crunching hard to finish this~! And about that Schranz collab... maybe we'll get to start it in Japan together ;;) Enjoy!!! 🙇⚡🚵",
