I chose this album to close off the album (remix aside), since it's quite dense and epic sounding, and sounds like a good lead for another album. Considering its games and anime inspirations like Sword Art Online, I thought it'd be interesting to end on an instrumental longer track than the rest of the album, similarly to how progressive rock bands do.",
