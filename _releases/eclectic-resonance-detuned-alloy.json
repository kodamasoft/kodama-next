				"• About this track: This track was originally written about 4 years ago in late-2019 for my application into my university's composition course, based on a short story by my lovely friend Owen (a.k.a. LEGOdawg2001) wrote as a prompt for creative ideas. I decided to use this album's theme as an excuse to revisit a composition I was still rather fond of even today to get it properly re-recorded and produced, while fixing up some of the more questionable aspects of the track along the way. I decided to add some narration to bake in some of the lore behind the story, inspired by the narration Ike Nelson often does for Sound Horizon. I hope you enjoy this new rendition of an old track I wrote that has never been shared publicly before!",

				"• About this track: In trying to come up with a name for this track, I listened to it back to back with my eyes closed. In my imagination, I pictured in anime-styled art, 2 childhood friends riding a bike exploring along the coast of Japan. The different parts of the songs represent different places they stopped at, the softer sections for the more homey mini-stops, and the intense sections for the more mind-blowing places. In the end, the track had to named \"Explore\". Maybe you can picture this scenario too? Plz do, otherwise I'll sound like I'm crazy :P"

				"• About this track: Yes im re-watching Code Geass right now, how did you guess? Thanks to blobdash for making me finish that track. I started this concept track in January 2023 after falling in love with the track \"TKG - Hit The Schranz\" which is of the same style. In October 2023, I worked on it again, rewriting most of the melody, overhauling the entire track, and finishing it, in the span of two days. Everything is MIDI! There aren't a single live guitar. I did a whole lot of humanization, which makes it sound quite full of life, pretty happy with that."

Seeing Detuned Alloy as a golden opportunity, I removed it from its \"shelf\" status, polished it up, and now it is complete. I named this track \"Bloom\" in reference to the band and to describe the process in which this track was brought to full \"Bloom\". Hope you enjoy it :)"
