There is usually still a sliver of hope that maybe, eventually, it can happen after all - but even that sentiment ends up being hurtful if we fixate on it too much. Still, there may be ways that we haven't thought of before or compromises that can be made to reach a similar outcome, making it worth to try again when we gather the courage. There are a lot of connections to witchcraft in this song, like the athame which is a ritualistic knife that can also cut through negative energies and ties and lead to a fresh start or the arcana which can often change ones perspective of things when drawing a card in dire times.",
