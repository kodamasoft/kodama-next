I wasn't able to make the time I wanted for it, and every day that passed this album loomed more and more over my head, pressuring me to make something or give up. Mere days before the deadline, I finally sat down and forced myself to make progress - and at that moment, all the inspiration hit me in a wave.  Despite believing I didn't have enough time, I was suddenly writing lyrics and using Synthesizer V 2 (which had released the same day), and I turned a minute-long snippet into 8 minutes of soaring emotions.  I think incorporating vocals ended up being critical to breathing life into this track - though she only appeared in brief bursts, Mo Xu's incredibly rich vocal qualities were the soul that I was trying to capture for so long.  It was immensely reassuring that I was able to pull through when it counted, and that it turned out how it did with so little time left.","","BPM: 140","Key: D minor","Genre: Uplifting Trance"]

I wanted to play with the idea of the song using repetition while still feeling varied enough, usually in most of my other songs I tend to introduce new ideas quite quickly instead of reusing what i have; meanwhile in this one I let it develop according to the ideas already established beforehand.","","BPM: 150","Key: F# Minor","Genre: Trance"]
