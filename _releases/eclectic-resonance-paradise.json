				"• About this track: I tried fusing elements from funk and house, and added some elements from “Colored”, a track I composed more than 20 years ago (the melody of the strings, the bouncing rhythm, the samples of string hits I put at the beginning and end of the song). And thus, I made a song that has a simple structure, but encapsulates elements that represent my life as a composer. [ファンク／ハウスにフュージョンの要素を混ぜ、さらに、私が20年以上昔に作ったColoredという曲の要素（ストリングスのメロディーや、少しだけ跳ねるリズム、最初と最後に設置したストリングス・ヒットのサンプル）も混ぜてみたら、シンプルな構造ではありますが、なんだかわたしの作曲人生を作り上げた要素が詰まった楽しい曲になりました。]",

				"• About this track: I knew I wanted to make a fusion track for this album, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to make it high energy or more low key. Considering the album's themes and the fact that I didn't have too much time, I decided to compose something more low key with a simple structure that would be fun to solo over. Over the course of composing and arranging this track, I ended up incorporating many elements from music I was listening to at the time. Some of the main inspirations were Gran Turismo 3 (Light Velocity specifically) and the Racing Lagoon soundtrack, but also T-Square (Trial Road), George Benson (Affirmation), Prince (Shhh) and more old funk and soul influence than I initially thought I'd put in.",

				"• About this track: PARADISE encompassed genres that I had worked in, but wanted more experience with, namely house. My EDM typically isn't so upbeat tonally, so I thought this album would be an especially interesting one for me to tackle. While it definitely took me time to get this off the ground and to settle on what I wanted to do, where I landed felt pretty solid. It might seem a silly revelation to some, but for me, the acoustic elements of this song - keys, guitars, brass, bass - all lent themselves to a house context better than I expected. What was also fun was implementing Latin percussion and drum patterns, the inclusion of which gave the track much more flair than if I had just stuck strictly to a typical house sound. I do hope I find myself drawn to this kind of music more in the future.",
