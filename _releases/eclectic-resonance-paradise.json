				"• About this track: This track focuses on the softer and meditative side of old school JRPG music.  It is one of my belief that JRPGs soundtracks did a lot of good for classical music. The extent of the influence of classical music in those kind of music is non-negligible and, as a result, an extraordinary amount of JRPGs got symphonic arrangements albums and concerts. A lot of those concerts, despite being held in usually classical venues, are often sold-out. Most of the people attending are young and not the kind to be classical concertgoers. The main instruments of this track are the violin and piano, two staples of western classical music, whether it is in chamber music or pieces written for large ensembles. The other instruments and sounds are almost all from an old rompler featured prominently in 90's RPGs, with most of these aforementioned RPGs seeing symphonic arrangements later down the line.",

Other than that, I also took inspiration from various folk music, especially Spanish ones. The harmonies and melodies also shows some influences from a Japanese band named Choro Club, who themselves are primarily influenced by diverse folk music. Those are all pretty natural influences and inspirations of mine, so this track is kind of a candid love letter to them.",

				"This track emerged when burnout was slowly encroaching. Earlier in the year, I had decided I would commit to Legendaria, feeling confident in my orchestration abilities after dabbling in fantasy music on two separate occasions. But the timing ended up being poor - my workload was the largest and most intimidating it'd ever been, events in my life had tested my will to press forward with music as a whole, and I was a little anxious about submitting to an album where I knew I'd be standing amongst giants. It seemed like everything around me was telling me \"no\", and so I got paralyzed by Legendaria, the task looking more and more daunting. My solution was brute force - powering through the turmoil because I figured I'd be better off for it. This track, \"Aeromancer\", is the result. The composition is soaring and triumphant, which I'm unsure how I pulled off amidst so much negativity. Jazz flavors are peppered in at various points, lending a slight chaos that the bright chorus section resolves beautifully. In arranging this song, I was reminded that this task should be one of joy and love for the craft, and it was easy to run with from there. While my circumstances will not improve immediately, I can always, without fail, forget my troubles with music, and \"Aeromancer\" is the proof of that.",
