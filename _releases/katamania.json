				"• About this track: I was looking for a good track to arrange, and ended up on this specific track. The terms \"shadow\" and \"light\" got some personal meaning thanks to my own stories. SO, it would be fitting for me to be the one to arrange this really cool song. The idea was to take the original sweet and calm tune and turn it into a more fast paced track with a touch of orchestral powermetal. So I guess this is now more of a track you would hear in the moment the prince decides to rise above them all show why he's the son of the king! (I guess this song plays while the prince destroys all the stars himself or something like that.) Btw I totally forgot there was a mecha-king in this game, huh. Ok what if the song represents the robo king destroying the stars once more, would that be better or worse? you decide whoever's reading! Build your own headcanon and tell me about it."

We believe in you. Roll up as many precious memories as you can find and restore the Star of Memories. The people want more Katamari Damacy!\" Hiya, this is Melody. I’ll try to keep this brief. Katamari Damacy means a lot to me, it got me through one of the worst parts of my life, being my little comfort game that I could boot up to escape anxiety. I have made so many wonderful memories rolling up different Katamari, so I want to share some of that warmth with anyone that's listening to this little track. A special shout out to Kurin T for being an absolute joy to work with, and to everyone at KodamaSounds for putting together this project. I hope you enjoy this little piece of my heart. Let’s roll up a wonderful memory Katamari together! (°◡°♡)",

All righty, good luck. We'll give you 10 minutes before boredom kicks in.\" The original Blue Orb plays as the Sun watches you collect the Earth and all the stars you made along your journey. It's a culmination of your progress and a dramatic conclusion of cosmic proportions. This track starts by referencing a chopped up version of the main katamari theme, played on the rhodes, and goes on to reference the music the player listened to when they made each star in the cosmos, followed by referencing the various tracks that play when selecting levels or viewing the cosmos from the games. The track plays out for 10 minutes and gradually grows and grows into more and more, referencing the origins of the stars and constellations being rolled up. References to Beautiful star (cosmos viewing theme) and Cosmos (results music) play at the end, bringing a conclusion to rolling up the sun. The track is through-composed, constantly changing and becoming more dramatic to represent all the different stars and the increasing size, with building drama and emotion reflecting the unimaginable scale of rolling up the cosmos, and then the sun itself. The original stage has no time limit, but this track plays as though it is the theme for a time limited 10 minute version of the stage.

				"Fivda: The Katamari series is one of the best things I've happened to play in the past decade. Nothing comes close to it, and playing it at long last was both liberating and intoxicating - the entire concept of the game, the love behind the people who made it, and obviously - the music. Despite being a song most people won't even notice, being on the Stars Viewing section of the game (which is kind of pointless...). Despite this, Katamari☆Stars is one of the most important songs in my life. I share fond memories of this song, and the implications behind my entire experience of playing Katamari Damacy for the first time are extremely important to me. The initial lyrics to this song exist and were written in French, so it's not all nonsense! They actually are quite important, intimate and personal. The title is still in french as well, and from that point I think you can easily guess what the song might be about. Which is one of the reasons why I decided to finalize the lyrics in a fictional language - a mix of French, English, Japanese and Spanish. That way, the true meaning behind the lyrics will remain a mystery to noone but myself and Aamna and I don't have to embarass the world with intelligible words... Eheh. When I finalized my mix and sent it to Tee-vee for mixing, it was like finding closure within closure. I'm very glad to have been able to complete this little arrangement, which was made so much more ambitious and more beautiful thanks to the many contributors of this song. I've been meaning to make this song for two years now. I am eternally grateful, thank you all so much!",
				"MB: Hi there! I know absolutely nothing about Katamari but I've always been keen on playing the games. This track is wonderful and I'm honoured to have been part of Fivda's arrangement of it. We discussed adding live acoustic guitar to the track and I improvised a Mitsuda-inspired bassline to go along with her arrangement on my acoustic bass! I hope you enjoy!",
