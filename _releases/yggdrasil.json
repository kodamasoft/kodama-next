					"• About this track: I wrote this piece back in 2023 during my music studies at The University of Melbourne. The music specialisations on offer at my university included Classical Performance, Jazz & Improvisation (J&I), Classical Composition, Interactive Composition (IC) and Musicology/Ethnomusicology. IC and J&I were originally courses offered by the former Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) curriculim, which has now been merged with the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music (MCM) at The University of Melbourne. Despite all these courses moving onto the same campus in 2019, students in the formerly VCA-based courses didn't often get the chance to interact with those studying under traditionally MCM-based courses, and vice versa. To oppose this arbitrary separation, I spent time making friends with students from the formerly VCA-based courses, and brought them together to create this piece. I invited two friends from IC, two friends from J&I and one friend from classical performance to play a piece that I, a classical composition student, composed for all of them. This piece represents this entanglement of disciplines that really aren’t all that different from each other, and the collaboration of all of our creative voices; drawing from art music, jazz and other experimental influences.",

					"• About KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary / YGGDRASIL's project: I came to be involved with KodamaSounds via my activities with Resonant Union, as our contributing artists often participated on both groups' projects.

That said, I'm truly grateful that Robin has been willing to accept and release these past compositions of mine on KodamaSounds' albums, and it's an honour to be part of such a large and growing group.",

It was a 2D platformer about a struggle between humanity and the evolving field of androids set in a dying world. Nothing ever came of it, but I owe learning sound design to that experience. I have fond memories of improvising on my midi keyboard while working, which was the foundation for this piece.

We supported each other even during the difficult moments, and I take away from this that, in the end, everyone genuinely wanted to create something good.",
					"eili: Its always fun to contribute to fantasy-esque music. The unique blend of Fantasy and other modern elements, like JPop, and Rock, makes the song feel like a fresh take on a beloved genre. Having live instruments always brings more punch and a personal touch to songs. I personally love singing songs whose lyrics blend more than one language, coined or otherwise.",
					"v1ris: It was such a joy to record violin for this song! YOKAI wrote such a beautiful, full-sounding string part for me to play.

					"YOKAI: I arrived at Kodama two years ago now, but it feels like so much longer! This year has been the most important one for me, with the release of my third album under the circle. This album was even pressed and distributed in Japan! It’s a dream I’ve had for a long time, one I thought was unattainable until now but the stars aligned with the live presentation of the album for M3. One aspect I particularly appreciate about Kodama is the natural kindness of its members, a strong sense of mutual support and community that encourages you to push yourself further. Even though we compose on our own, there are always plenty of members available. Personally, I find this amazing because I love creating alone but surrounding myself with others when it’s needed. A big thank you to Kodama for everything it brings me, both creatively and personally, in my own individual growth!",

There are so many wonderful people I've met through it, and it's always an honor and a privilege to have contributed to its projects, whether I'm arranging/composing, or playing violin (which you can hear me play on YGGDRASIL!)",

The result is a chaos like no other, and arguably my most ridiculous composition to date. 4 different drum kits, 3 different rhythm guitar tones, and many different piano/synth layers, the project looks just as chaotic as the music sounds. The title \"The Nine Worlds\", besides being an obvious reference to Yggdrasil, also refers to the roughly 9 different stylistic changes throughout the song, and the 9 musical references (memes) scattered about. Like I said, chaos. Either way, this is was genuinely fun to make and I hope you get a laugh out of this stupid track :)",

					"• About KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary / YGGDRASIL's project: Kodama has always been the perfect place to really push my composition.

With Kodama, even with the VGM arrangement projects, it always feels like it is encouraged to strive to push boundaries, even if it doesn't make sense. Yggdrasil, I feel, is the project that is really saying \"go wild\", and to have several artists on this project go wild is going to create something unforgettable. Happy 5th anniversary Kodama!!!",

Due to your enlightenment, you are virtually everywhere all of the time. You have therefore chosen to become a Monk of Fate, meaning that you never engage in conflict or directly intervene in anything that has, is or will ever happen. This is for the best, since while you're dealing with your friends, you're also having a lovely tea party with space bunnies, and witnessing an extensive battlefield too, among other things. Everything is happening around you all the time, which is why you find it hard to concentrate on anything, despite being good at multitasking. However, if you were to kick some hypothetical ass, which has never happened nor will it ever occur, this would play in the background.",

(I don't think this solves my own problem of feeling out of place lmao.) In general, I haven't been in the best place mentally. I wrote a whole blog about how I \"gave up\" trying to reach people with my music. And yet, getting invited cheered me up enough to make something incredible, and I think that's the best thing about working with KodamaSounds. They're a group of people who love making music of all kinds. And that love is contagious, it inspires everyone to keep making music. I think that's what matters most. So despite my own self doubt, I made something that I think is great, the coolest song I've put together so far. And I hope everyone in KodamaSounds, including myself, keep making amazing music that inspires others forever.",

The track is inspired by the portion of Japanese Trance that fuses traditional instruments with the modern Trance, creating something both new and in respect to the old. The emotion of this track is inspired in part by the Shinto, Buddhist and Celtic beliefs in sacred nature, and the uncountable aspects worthy of respect.",

					"• About KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary / YGGDRASIL's project: KodamaSounds publishes so many talented musicians, producers, alike, and it is with my whole heart I present Amaranthine to represent just a portion of KodamaSounds. I chose specifically a track I was passionate about, and one specifically I had failed to finish 5 years ago when I was much more new to music production, to bring back to life for KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary celebration. As reference to the divine nature of the mythological YGGDRASIL, I chose to represent forms of investment into divinity within my work. I also chose to combine new and old, as KodamaSounds does itself in its albums of wide varieties of music, and albums of celebrating modern culture. KodamaSounds was one of the first consistently professional quality music publishing groups I ever contributed to, and I am very grateful for these opportunities to make what I am passionate about alongside other talented musicians.

Since becoming a member of the KodamaSounds family in 2022 (w/ Moriya Barista), I've come to appreciate that everyone here truly excels at producing great tunes and doing great things. I'm honored to have had the opportunity to feature in previous albums, and to also have my track included in this ambitious project. Like most pursuits in life, making music has had its requisite share of ups and downs—who knows if I'll still be doing this in another five years? But, like the title of my track, I'll strive first and foremost to continue to follow my heart, going wherever it goes. A myriad thanks to Fivda and the rest of the KodamaSounds staff for making all this possible, and here's to more great tunes and albums in the future!",

Having started out in chiptune, I am very pleased to have been featured alongside the other spectacular artists on the \"ECLECTIC RESONANCE Memories\" albums. Having also been featured on the second \"UPRISING\" release, I can't say I feel I'm on the same level as other contributors, though the energy on display makes me want to get better! It's been wonderful to be associated with a circle that resonates such positive energy, and I'm always excited to see each new release. For YGGDRASIL, I tried not to come in with any preconception of what I should make. I did my best to sit down and let something come out. I had recently bought a Korg opsix as a hardware synth and controller, and decided to put it to work here. Almost all elements of the track, save for percussion and effects, were generated and recorded from the opsix. I usually work exclusively with softsynths, so the change of pace was invigorating! I ended up with something pretty airy, floating somewhere between techno and trance. I was expecting to make something harder if I'm honest, but perhaps I'm stuck in the clouds... I am at a point in my life where I am forced to balance my creative spirit with harsh realities and responsibilities. This circle has helped me maintain that balance. It's been a pleasure to contribute what I can, and I hope to do so well into the future. Happy 5th, KodamaSounds!! o(*￣▽￣*)o",

					"• About this track: This track is heavily inspired by Foregone Destruction from Unreal Tournament. Since I've been through a lot these past few years, I wanted to make a song all about staying true to yourself despite adversity, so being inspired by something from my childhood definitely helped in that feeling. I decided to go with the name \"Yesod\" because its the foundation node of the kabbalistic tree of life and has sort of a balancing role. Having to balance yourself as you grow and experience harsher things while trying to keep your childhood memories and spirit as close to you as humanly possible is probably one of the greatest challenges to face in the modern day, it feels like it's so much easier to lose yourself with everything going on. It's always good to remember your roots and to stay as grounded as possible. Someday, I hope we can live in a world where everyone is happy and free.

Robin is very nice and understanding, and any time I'm able to participate, I do my best to. Everyone in the circle is so incredibly skilled at what they do, and every song I hear from the others blows me away! It keeps me inspired to get even better at music, I want to reach a point where my music elicits emotions from the people that listen to it. Everyone's been wearing tougher masks lately, but I've always wanted my music to be a cushion for people to relax and listen to, if only to be themselves for a moment. I'll do my best to keep getting even better, and I hope to continue to show up in more KodamaSounds projects in the future! Happy 5th anniversary!",

					"• About this track: Originally this was meant to be an RPG battle theme. Specifically, for a tutorial section/area. Not for the very start of the game, it's too energetic for that.  But for like, Disk 2, after the protagonist has a full party and has gotten their shiny new power up that makes them extra super duper special. ‘Cause special brand new powers means you gotta have special brand new enemies. Otherwise, things would be boring. And we don't want things to be boring...  right? Now, I'd say it's more of a character theme.  A happy little mantra of sorts. To get one through tough times. Mantra of what exactly? I dunnuh. It's a mystery. Anyway, With it originally being an RPG theme, it was supposed to be a quick 4 minute loop. But then around the 5 minute mark I shifted the bass a little more than I should've.  And like an idiot I went \"Oooh that sounds nice, I should expand on that.\" And then BAM, suddenly it's 10 minutes long with almost no repeating sections. Establishing a melody? A distinct leitmotif? What's that mean?  Who knows? Certainly not me. Though, complaints aside, I guess it didn't turn out all that bad.",

The drop introduces a formant-driven, talky lead, symbolizing the voices and conversations happening behind her back.

I didn't feel like what I was making fit the general theme of that album, so I shelved it, hoping to find a use for it in a solo original album release. But my solo music took a backseat this year due to my growing commitments to remix collectives and game soundtrack work. Any self-released album that this track could have been included on never came to fruition, and no community albums had a theme that easily accommodated this. Enter YGGDRASIL, with which I largely had creative freedom to approach the project how I wanted. The status and exclusivity of the album pushed me to do more with the WIP than I otherwise would have, and what started as a minute-long sketch blossomed into 6 minutes of drum & bass and artcore sounds. To me, the relentless intensity evokes a battle to achieve some sort of divine power. I hope my track gives anybody listening the feeling that they can do anything, that they can even attain GODHOOD.",

					"• About KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary / YGGDRASIL's project: I first learned about KodamaSounds in 2023 when I stumbled across a Twitter post from them. At this time, I had only a few months ago decided I wanted to pursue music composition professionally, and I was looking for communities I could contribute to, so I could build a portfolio. At the tail end of 2023, I made my first KodamaSounds appearance on Katamania!! -a Katamari tribute album-. Since then, I've gotten heavily involved in Kodama's albums. The ECLECTIC RESONANCE series in particular has been an immensely fun and valuable challenge in diversifying my portfolio and skillset, and I've greatly enjoyed maintaining a streak of appearances (up until Memories 2, so sad). Every album theme has given me new inspiration and new avenues of exploring and refining my sound, and I unquestionably would not be the musician I am today without the consistency of Kodama's projects. 2 years after my first Kodama appearance, I'm back once again to deliver a track for this 5th anniversary album. In terms of both my prowess and my career, a lot has changed in that relatively short time. I am the most confident producer I can be right now, and I have notable game composing credits to my name, which seemed a distant impossibility back in 2023. The journey to these achievements was made with KodamaSounds being a constant spotlight on my portfolio. I'm proud to be a small piece of the circle's history, enough to have the privilege of being on YGGDRASIL.",

Having released Scabra Tangat Fidei at the same time as Gensokyo Party Vol. 1, I feel especially that I've grown alongside KodamaSounds, and not just in age. In terms of favourite KodamaSounds release, definitely Escapism. trance just hits differently when you need it. For this album specifically, it's my biggest project so far, with the playlist count at ~240. I like the 2nd half a lot. In relation to my experience making music over these years, I suppose I just make stuff I like, definitely improved a lot with composition, sound design, mixing, mastering, well everything really since 2020/1, and certainly a million times better than when i started at the end of 2015.

					"• About this track: I started working on this song since... Early 2024. I thought to myself, just two days away from the true final song submission deadline, \"well, there's no way i'll see myself being content with finishing this song when I'll actually get better.\" so there was hardly any better time than to submit it for YGGDRASIL, which is a project about growth and reflection on the past. This song represents a lot of negative feelings, which I've struggled with for quite some time now - mainly jealousy, greed, envy, grief, a lot of other raw emotions, and the general sense of being unable to do and be what I strive to be. Ever since I started working on this track, 2024 was definitely a turning point in my life, and a lot happened - mostly good things, for a change. 2025 was very stressful, eventful, busy and fragile in comparison. I think a good half of this song was represented fairly well within this track, for what it's worth. The frenchcore/IDM drop part is definitely my proudest work in sound expression so far, although the song still greatly suffers from abrupt structure changes and a lack of actual sound design/composition craft. The gibberish of voices we hear at the end is a lot of those keywords (emotions) I mentionned above, in different languages, that I've recorded and altered myself. It's a corny and cheesy way of expressing such feelings, especially with the distortion and invasive effects, but it has its charm and gets the point across. I really wanted to create a song that could truly feel \"overwhelming\", but at the same time, I wanted to give it a monotoneous/accelerating techno twist to feel like you're running out of breath. I wouldn't call this song my magnum opus, but it's definitely a track I wanted to complete one day, and I think it's an important part of myself that I somewhat managed to put on paper in some way. I have so many ideas, so much i want to express, and I feel like I've reached the apex of what I can accomplish without training further and... Actually making more efforts into crafting something truly meaningful. I don't think it's perfectionnism speaking, I just strictly feel like I cannot do what I truly want to make at all without putting in the efforts to do it. But... Yeah, my difficulties in learning, and accepting myself make it really difficult. Hence the track name, \"fundamentally dysfunctional\", which represents not only some issues in my psyche/way of communicating with others, but also about facing bewilderment when trying to craft something that truly feels like \"you\". You know what? Let's accept this song as a success in self expresison, for once. It's what truly matters in the end, isn't it.",

					"• About KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary / YGGDRASIL's project: I've always lived a hectic life of art and creativity. Every few years, my tastes change greatly, and so do my projects. Years back, I don't think I could imagine myself in the position I am today. I think I can confidently say that KodamaSounds is the best thing I've ever created of my life. It's insane to me that we've gone this far, and there is no sign of stopping. It has made me meet hundreds of amazing friends and artists, and it made me learn from my mistakes and successes to grow better as a person. Although there was growth and progress, it's still really hard to say I live the kind of life I wish I was living. YGGDRASIL is all about acceptance, growth, getting better, reflecting, and moving on. I hope you can listen to this album with as much awe as I do, and that this album will make you feel a connection with each and everyone's hard work and sweat in some form. People live, people create, people die, people grief, and other people will carry your name forever in your heart - be it through art or acts of kindness. I hope that in the same way, my name and KodamaSounds' will always be remembered by at least one person. I hope that everyone lives a brighter day and future, and that through hard and dark times, we shall carry lights and memories that will shine as bright as our creative souls will make them. I am eternally thankful to all of the artists that have trusted me, and helped me make this dream a reality. I am looking forward to the future in a way I couldn't have ever imagined. Thank you! #KODAMASWEEP",
