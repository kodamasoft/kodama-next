					"• About this track: I wrote this piece back in 2023 during my music studies at The University of Melbourne. The music specialisations on offer at my university included Classical Performance, Jazz & Improvisation (J&I), Classical Composition, Interactive Composition (IC) and Musicology/Ethnomusicology. IC and J&I were originally courses offered by the former Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) curriculim, which has now been merged with the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music (MCM) at The University of Melbourne. Despite all these courses moving onto the same campus in 2019, students in the formerly VCA-based courses didn't often get the chance to interact with those studying under traditionally MCM-based courses, and vice versa. To oppose this arbitrary separation, I spent time making friends with students from the formerly VCA-based courses, and brought them together to create this piece. I invited two friends from IC, two friends from J&I and one friend from classical performance to play a piece that I, a classical composition student, composed for all of them. This piece represents this entanglement of disciplines that really aren’t all that different from each other, and the collaboration of all of our creative voices; drawing from art music, jazz and other experimental influences.",

					"• About KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary / YGGDRASIL's project: I came to be involved with KodamaSounds via my activities with Resonant Union, as our contributing artists often participated on both groups' projects.

That said, I'm truly grateful that Robin has been willing to accept and release these past compositions of mine on KodamaSounds' albums, and it's an honour to be part of such a large and growing group.",

It was a 2D platformer about a struggle between humanity and the evolving field of androids set in a dying world. Nothing ever came of it, but I owe learning sound design to that experience. I have fond memories of improvising on my midi keyboard while working, which was the foundation for this piece.

We supported each other even during the difficult moments, and I take away from this that, in the end, everyone genuinely wanted to create something good.",
					"eili: Its always fun to contribute to fantasy-esque music. The unique blend of Fantasy and other modern elements, like JPop, and Rock, makes the song feel like a fresh take on a beloved genre. Having live instruments always brings more punch and a personal touch to songs. I personally love singing songs whose lyrics blend more than one language, coined or otherwise.",
					"v1ris: It was such a joy to record violin for this song! YOKAI wrote such a beautiful, full-sounding string part for me to play.

					"YOKAI: I arrived at Kodama two years ago now, but it feels like so much longer! This year has been the most important one for me, with the release of my third album under the circle. This album was even pressed and distributed in Japan! It’s a dream I’ve had for a long time, one I thought was unattainable until now but the stars aligned with the live presentation of the album for M3. One aspect I particularly appreciate about Kodama is the natural kindness of its members, a strong sense of mutual support and community that encourages you to push yourself further. Even though we compose on our own, there are always plenty of members available. Personally, I find this amazing because I love creating alone but surrounding myself with others when it’s needed. A big thank you to Kodama for everything it brings me, both creatively and personally, in my own individual growth!",

There are so many wonderful people I've met through it, and it's always an honor and a privilege to have contributed to its projects, whether I'm arranging/composing, or playing violin (which you can hear me play on YGGDRASIL!)",

The result is a chaos like no other, and arguably my most ridiculous composition to date. 4 different drum kits, 3 different rhythm guitar tones, and many different piano/synth layers, the project looks just as chaotic as the music sounds. The title \"The Nine Worlds\", besides being an obvious reference to Yggdrasil, also refers to the roughly 9 different stylistic changes throughout the song, and the 9 musical references (memes) scattered about. Like I said, chaos. Either way, this is was genuinely fun to make and I hope you get a laugh out of this stupid track :)",

					"• About KodamaSounds' 5th Anniversary / YGGDRASIL's project: Kodama has always been the perfect place to really push my composition. Being part of the VGM arrangement scene, there's always this sense of limiting, be it genre wise, or making sure you can still hear parts of the original composition. With Kodama, even with the VGM arrangement projects, it always feels like it is encouraged to strive to push boundaries, even if it doesn't make sense. Yggdrasil, I feel, is the project that is really saying \"go wild\", and to have several artists on this project go wild is going to create something unforgettable. Happy 5th anniversary Kodama!!!",

Due to your enlightenment, you are virtually everywhere all of the time. You have therefore chosen to become a Monk of Fate, meaning that you never engage in conflict or directly intervene in anything that has, is or will ever happen. This is for the best, since while you're dealing with your friends, you're also having a lovely tea party with space bunnies, and witnessing an extensive battlefield too, among other things. Everything is happening around you all the time, which is why you find it hard to concentrate on anything, despite being good at multitasking. However, if you were to kick some hypothetical ass, which has never happened nor will it ever occur, this would play in the background.",

(I don't think this solves my own problem of feeling out of place lmao.) In general, I haven't been in the best place mentally. I wrote a whole blog about how I \"gave up\" trying to reach people with my music. And yet, getting invited cheered me up enough to make something incredible, and I think that's the best thing about working with KodamaSounds. They're a group of people who love making music of all kinds. And that love is contagious, it inspires everyone to keep making music. I think that's what matters most. So despite my own self doubt, I made something that I think is great, the coolest song I've put together so far. And I hope everyone in KodamaSounds, including myself, keep making amazing music that inspires others forever.",
