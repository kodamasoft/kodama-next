The melodic aspects were influenced by the music from Streets of Rage and Superman (Genesis/MD), with The Smurfs' Nightmare (GB) thrown in for the climax. I hope I've succeeded in bringing more modern genres to NES/FC chiptune. Special thanks to marklincadet, who provided invaluable feedback throughout the production of this track.",

One of the inside jokes we had in our community is that you can make the Sega Genesis sound system mimic the Neo Geo's, so I had that goal in mind for this track. I also limited myself to 64kb in terms of samples and sequence data to make it more interesting, and show how capable it is if had the similar limitations to storage space on the SNES's sound system. Other than the technical stuff, this track is channeling the house music that would be made in Japan. Yes, I \"stole\" that sax riff from Shinichiro Yokota's \"Time Lapse\"(it's pretty good), but I sprinkled in some musical references from my other compositions. Overall, I had fun making this and I hope that others enjoy it too.",

					"• About this track: At the end of it all, in the pouring rain, a crossing of blades. After raging for what feels like hours, one mistake is all it takes. Lying on the wet soil, bleeding, looking up at the sword. Heart racing, lungs heaving. The weight of every loss, pressing down so hard. With one great crack of thunder, it all goes white...then, her voice. \"Not like you to be flat on your ass. What was it you used to say? 'As long as you're here, I'll keep fighting.' Well, here I am. Now, STAND UP!\"",

					"• About this track: I composed this piece while thinking about the cats at my parents' house. They roam freely around our peaceful home, and I imagine that they sometimes find themselves in places and doing things that I could never guess. Through the piece's dizzying developments and irregular time signatures, I tried to express their charming yet mysterious habits. For example, the piece begins E major, and undergoes a series of modulations through 12 kinds major keys (in my interpretation), before returns to E major. This represents the presence of their fixed position (such as a cushion) upon their return from a big adventure.",
					"I hope you enjoy it. [私の実家の猫たちに思いを馳せて制作しました。彼らは平穏な我が家を自由に歩き回り、私が想像もつかない場所へ行き、想像もつかない行動を取っているのでしょう。彼らのそんな愛らしくもミステリアスな生態を、曲の目まぐるしい展開や変拍子として表現してみました。例えば、この曲はホ長調に始まり、(私の解釈では)12種類の長調への転調を経て、再びホ長調に戻ってくるといった仕掛けを施しました。これは彼らが大冒険から戻った際、定位置(クッションなど)に落ち着く様子を表しています。お楽しみいただければ幸いです。]",
