# ECLECTIC RESONANCE Memories 2

*The cogs of nostalgia and electronic music are in gear, roaming in unison. From simple happy melodies to the depths of complex audio programming, it’s up to you to complete your task. ECLECTIC RESONANCE Memories is all about Chiptune & FM Music.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“Memories” is the Chiptune and FM Music variant of our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series. Globally inspired by retro game music and FM synths, the idea is to make chiptune music, purely and simply, with no specific music style restrictions. Using a tracker or FM synths is heavily recommended, but you do not have to follow this rule to perfection to participate.

<WrappableParagraph title="Memories Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be entirely original in its entirety, and you must hold the rights of your composition. No partial arrangement of any series should be present in your submission.
- Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes long, and cannot exceed 8 minutes.
- Your track must be within the style aimed for Memories. This album will focus on songs that emphasize the appeal of chiptune. Therefore, ensure that your submission contains elements that are recognizable or associated with chiptune. Defining what is and isn’t chiptune is impossible; if you can make a decent argument for why your track counts as chiptune, we will allow it.
