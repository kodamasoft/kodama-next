# ECLECTIC RESONANCE PARADISE

*Stash your worries away for now, let’s just go on a nice trip and transform your frown into a smile. Come over for a ride, and don’t forget your sunglasses and your sunscreen!*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“PARADISE” is another entry in our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series, with a focus on genres with an upbeat, tropical, poppy and energetic sonority. Inspired by the carefree sounding nature of pre-2000 free jazz, jazz fusion and funk tunes, PARADISE also focuses on more modern and lighter sounding genres of EDM, such as House, Garage and Electroswing.
