Hello everyone, with the amount of news this Spring, we think we owe you another KodamaNews Post\! If you don’t want to bother reading, feel free to scroll all the way below of this post to find the schedule of releases for the coming year.

## Solo Album Projects

We have not one, but two Solo Album projects to be published under KodamaSounds this year. The first one is a brand new addition, which will be a Touhou Best Album compilation by \[REDACTED\] planned for release at Japan Expo 2025 in Paris as a CD, which will have a digital Bandcamp+BOOTH distribution on the side some time after. The other one was planned to release for M3-55, but due to the tight scheduling, we preferred keeping it safe by releasing it for Comic Market 106 instead.

## Physical Releases

There is some information to take in when it comes to our physical releases, so here is a little summary:

1. We will distribute our first physical album, a Touhou Best album by an in-house KodamaSounds artist, which will be released for Japan Expo 2025 as a CD distributed by [Touhou Bohu](http://touhoubohu.ch/) on July 3rd.  
2. A Reitaisai or M3-Spring release for the CD of Gensokyo Party Vol. 1 would be a bit too tight (April/May), considering we’re still working on new assets. Therefore, if it does happen, it will be during Summer Comic Market (August 16th), likely distributed by [Four Corners](https://x.com/4CornersDoujin).   
3. We should be able to publish a physical CD release of \[REDACTED\]’s 3rd Solo Album for Comic Market (August 16th) alongside Gensokyo Party Vol. 1 at the same time, distributed by [Four Corners](https://x.com/4CornersDoujin) as well.  
4. Since **ECLECTIC RESONANCE PARADISE** releases during the same Comic Market event, we are thinking of distributing download cards of the compilation at the same time. This way we will be able to advertise and sell the project alongside the other physical releases at a lower cost.  
5. Due to budgeting reasons, Gensokyo Party Vol. 6 Border in Stasis probably will not benefit from a physical release just yet. Please look forward to its digital release on May 5th, very soon\!  
6. UPRISING 3 and Memories 2 CD releases are planned to be published for M3-Fall, with our own personal booth as well\!

We don’t have any other physical release planned, but that’s already quite a lot considering our position. Please also note that some projects are bound to not make it due to tight budget. Remember that **funding [KodamaSounds through Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/kodamasoft) is the best way to support us,** and help us fund physical releases if you want to see more\!

## Touhou Fractured Transience Original Soundtrack

You may have seen [Tights’ statement about Touhou Fractured Transience being discontinued](https://twitter.com/StuffTight/status/1906288037568389279). The game will release some time in the coming weeks in a half-finished state, as it currently is right now. The developper is very open to the project being directed by someone else entirely, but for now, the game is in the hands of its other main animator. Please rest assured that its soundtrack release will happen nonetheless, **in a completed state**. We are unsure of the exact time the game and soundtrack will release, but probably throughout April or May. We are very proud of what we have accomplished for this project, with more than 20 songs finalized for it, and if the game does end up being continued by another individual or group, we will gladly continue contributing music to this beautiful project. For now, the mastering is being finalized, and we will proceed with the crossfades and communication/distribution soon after. Please look forward to the game and its music\!

## COUNTERFEST RECORDS Deadline Changes

Due to a lot of circumstances, new collaborative projects, and the planned release of many albums for the first half of 2025, two projects were impacted in some decisions, mainly for our two upcoming COUNTEREFEST RECORDS releases.

### SpeedSTARS \-a Ridge Racer tribute album-

We have to move the deadlines of SpeedSTARS \-a Ridge Racer tribute album- so that artists properly get enough time to produce songs for it. The new release date is now planned for **September 1st**, with songs deadlines for **August 1st,** which means that any artist who were previously interested in submitting for SpeedSTARS but couldn’t find the time to now have a bigger timeframe to do it. If there is any artist you know about who would be a good match for this album, please suggest them to us so we can contact them for the album’s newly planned release.  
Guidelines: [https://kodamasoft.net/projects/eclectic-resonance-paradise](https://counterfest.kodamasoft.net/en/projects/speedstars)

The new deadlines are as followed:

- **August 1st**: All tracks must have been finished, mixed and sent to us. Songs won’t be possible to submit after this time, unless negotiated with the album organiser.
- **August 15th**: Mastering completion.
- **August 22nd**: Audio Crossfade completion.
- **August 25th**: Video Crossfade completion.
- **September 1st**: Announcement & Final release of the album

### Vanilla Parfait \-a Vanillaware tribute album-

Unfortunately, due to the deluge of releases for this year, and the lack of progression and submission for this specific project, this is the first time we have to axe a deadline altogether due to lack of interest. Therefore, Vanilla Parfait will release or have a proper deadline only when we will reach a good enough amount of content (such as at least 7 tracks, or around 40 minutes of runtime). We hope that this album can at least release sometime next year, but we figure that for a niche project of this scale, it’s better for us to take our time than rush it or have it release with too small of a momentum. We apologize for any artist or listener who was looking for this album’s release this year, but we hope it just means even more polish for this important project.

### Schedule

That’s a lot to take in, but if you just want a general table of our plans and releases for this year, please refer to this image\! This is by far our busiest year, and we hope you’ll follow and support us through the intensity of all of those massive projects.
